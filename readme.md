# Test

I test different tech in `~/test`. Folders from there are often open source with `-test` at the end and can be seen [here](https://github.com/nikivdev?tab=repositories&q=-test&type=source).

## Contributing

Any PR to any of the test repos are welcome. [codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) & [cursor](https://cursor.com) are nice for dev. Great **working** & **useful** patches are most appreciated (ideally).
